## 1. Overview

### Linux origin

Unix originated in the late 1960s at Bell Labs, created by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. It began as a project to develop a multi-user, time-sharing operating system. Initially, it ran on a small computer called the PDP-7, but its simplicity and portability quickly gained attention. Unix's use of the C programming language, developed alongside it, made it versatile and easy to adapt to various hardware. It laid the groundwork for many modern operating systems.

### What is Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system modeled after Unix. It was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish software engineer, as a personal project while he was a university student. His goal was to develop a free and flexible operating system that anyone could use, modify, and distribute. Linux quickly gained popularity because of its collaborative development model and adaptability, becoming the foundation for countless systems, from servers to smartphones (like Android).

### Linux and windows 

Linux and windows are two major operating systems that differs in several fundamental ways. While Linux being an oper-source OS that everyone can use, modify or distribute. In constrast, Windows is a close-source OS made by Microsoft that required paying for access.

With Linux having many distributions that users can modify from the source to suit the user's need based on their preference. On the other hand, Windows are only limited to the surface-level where user can customize themes and basic settings.

## 2. Linux distribution and license 

Linux has a wide-range of distribution suitable for each preferences and user need. Some of the most well-known distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux, RHEL, CentOS, and openSUSE.

### RHEL and CentOS Distribution

RHEL is a distribution developed by Red Hat. It is known for its stability, reliability and security. With its subscription-based system, providing users with extensive support, updates, and access to a wealth of documentation and resources. It is widely used in corporate environments, data centers, and on servers due to its robust performance and reliability.

CentOS was originally a free, community-supported clone of RHEL, offering the same features and capabilities without the cost of a subscription. It was popular among small businesses and developers who wanted a reliable enterprise-grade system but didn’t require Red Hat’s official support.

### Linux Licensing

Linux is licensed with the GNU General Public License (GPL), a document devised for the GNU project by the Free Software Foundation. The GPL allows anybody to redistribute, and even sell, a product covered by the GPL, as long as the recipient is allowed to rebuild an exact copy of the binary files from source.

### Development Cycle

Linux distributions usually go through these cycles:

**Upstream Development:** This phase involves improvements and bug fixes to the Linux kernel and associated software by the global open-source community.

**Integration:** Distribution maintainers select kernel versions, software, and tools to create a cohesive system.

**Testing:** Distributions undergo thorough testing to ensure stability, security, and performance.

**Release:** A stable version is officially released, which may include Long-Term Support (LTS) for extended maintenance.

**Updates and Patches:** The maintainers provide regular updates for bug fixes, security patches, and software upgrades during the distribution's lifecycle.

### Organization Contribution

**Linux Foundation:** A nonprofit organization that supports the growth of Linux and open-source projects. It provides resources for developers and hosts events like the Open Source Summit.

**GitLab:** A platform that facilitates collaboration on Linux-related projects. For example, Kali Linux uses GitLab to attract community contributions and streamline its development process.
